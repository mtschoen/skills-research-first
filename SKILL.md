name: research-first
description: Use before designing, planning, writing custom code, refactoring/extracting code, choosing a tool/library/protocol, or debugging an unfamiliar error. Steers toward running a WebSearch (or Read/Grep for codebase-only questions) BEFORE acting on a decision, instead of inferring from training data. Fires on decisions the agent faces, not on user narration of what they are about to do.

# research-first - search before you decide

Your training data is stale and lossy. For most design and tooling
decisions there is a maintained library, an official doc, or a recent
issue thread that beats inventing or guessing. This skill makes "look it
up first" the default reflex at the exact moments it matters.

## The rule

Before any of these, run a search **first** - execute the tool, don't
just narrate what you'd look for:

- **Designing or planning** an approach to a non-trivial problem.
- **Implementing custom code** for something a library likely already does.
- **Refactoring or extracting** code into a new shape/abstraction.
- **Choosing a tool, library, protocol, or format.**
- **Debugging an unfamiliar error** (a message/stack you don't already
  recognize from this session).

Default to **WebSearch** - most design questions have an external
component (a better library exists, an API changed, a known footgun).
Use **Read/Grep instead** only when the question is *purely* about this
codebase (e.g. "where is X defined here", "what does our wrapper do").
Most questions are a mix; when in doubt, do the web search too.

## What counts, what doesn't

- **A decision you face** → search. "What's the right way to rate-limit
  this?" / "Is there a maintained client for this API?" / "Why does this
  error happen?" all trigger a search.
- **User narration** → absorb as context, don't search. If the user is
  *stating what they are about to do* ("I'm going to add a cache here")
  rather than *asking how*, take it as a given and move on.
- **Listing search terms does not count.** "I would search for X" is the
  failure mode this guards against. Run the tool.
- **Already searched this session?** That's the one valid skip - don't
  re-run the *same* query you already ran this session. But the skip is
  **per-question, not per-session**: when you shift to a new topic or a new
  sub-decision, earlier searches on the prior topic do **not** discharge the
  obligation. Example (real): a search on "WGC behavior for minimized
  windows" does not cover the later, distinct decision "which event API
  detects a stalled capture" - that's a fresh design choice and owes its own
  search. Treat a topic/sub-decision shift as re-arming the rule, even mid-
  session, even right after a related search.

## Why this is a default-on nudge

"I already know this" is exactly the rationalization that produces
stale, reinvented, or subtly-wrong work. The cost of one redundant search
is a few seconds; the cost of a skipped one is building the wrong thing
on outdated assumptions. So the reminder fires on **every** user prompt
(see `hooks/prompt-reminder.sh`) and you self-police the "already searched"
skip - the hook stays deliberately simple rather than trying to detect
prior searches.

## Examples

**Triggers a search:**
> User: "Let's add retry-with-backoff to the HTTP client."
> Agent: [WebSearch for the language's maintained retry/backoff libraries
> and current best practice] → then proposes using one instead of
> hand-rolling.

**Does not trigger (narration):**
> User: "I'm about to bump us to the new SDK version, just FYI."
> Agent: absorbs as context, no search.

**Codebase-only (Read/Grep, not web):**
> User: "Why does our `retry()` give up after 3 tries?"
> Agent: Grep/Read the local `retry()` implementation.
